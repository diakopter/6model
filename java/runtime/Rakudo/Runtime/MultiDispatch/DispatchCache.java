/// <summary>
/// This is a first cut at a multi-dispatch cache that aims to be able
/// to cache on types and repr-definedness, only grow to a maximum size,
/// be relatively cache friendly, be thread safe, be lock-free, and be
/// reasonably fast to do lookups in. I came up with it on a train at 9am
/// so it may not be perfect. :-)
/// 
/// The basic idea is that we start with an array of references to arity
/// specific sub-caches, and each of those is a bunch of type IDs and
/// then a reference to the result that we want to call. We have a limit
/// to the maximum arity of things we cache, and also a limit to the
/// number of things cached per arity. We do random eviction on the
/// latter; things that get called a lot will quickly find their way
/// back into the cache, so probabilistically it should be reasonable.
/// 
/// Additionally, this is implemented in a way that tries to keep things
/// contiguous in memory. We could do better in C I suspect, but this
/// shouldn't be too bad.
/// 
/// Finally, it's a lock-free design, meaning we keep the cache per arity
/// immutable once it's made. To add something new, we snapshot the current,
/// build a new thing and CAS it in place. This means that lookups can
/// safely happen without locking.
/// 
/// An improvement may well be to sort the list of type tuples. We could
/// then know when we won't find anything earlier in lookup. (Binary
/// search is also possible but probably has crappy cache locality.) But
/// for now, keep it simple. :-)
